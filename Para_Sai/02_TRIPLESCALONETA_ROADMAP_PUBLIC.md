# TripleScaloneta Roadmap (Public Version)

**As of 2026-02-22**

TripleScaloneta is the experimental ladder for one central question:
how much transferable information can ratio structure provide under cross-modality deep learning setups.

## Program Map

| Escalon | Objective | Current Status | Advancement Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Escalon 1 (Audio <-> MIDI) | Measure ratio-information gain in a high-quality paired benchmark | Active, strongest evidence block | Close Gate 4.5 pending runs and finalize Gate 5 decision package |
| Escalon 2 (Speech <-> EGG) | Validate the same ratio logic in a different paired-sensor regime | Planned | Escalon 1 closure bundle + reproducible mechanism shortlist |
| Escalon 3 (ECG <-> PPG) | Stress-test generality of ratio logic in biomedical signals | Planned | Escalon 2 positive transfer criteria met |

## Escalon 1 Internal Milestone View

| Stage | Status | Message |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 0-2.5 | Closed | Foundational pipeline and baseline comparability established |
| Gate 3 (DANN) | Closed (NO-GO) | Adversarial invariance did not provide robust gain |
| Gate 4.2 | Closed | Ratio descriptor benefit depends on injection mechanism |
| Gate 4.3 | Closed | Strong signal from descriptor/mechanism combinations |
| Gate 4.4 | Closed | Major architecture screening completed |
| Gate 4.5 | In progress | Scheduler/depth optimization with mixed outcomes |
| Gate 5A / 5B | Pending | Full sweep + scientific showcase after 4.5 closure |

## Dual-Path Read of the Same Roadmap

1. **Research path:** each escalon strengthens or weakens HIT claims through controlled evidence.
2. **Model path:** each escalon improves the ratio-native model stack (representations, mechanisms, schedules).

## Why TripleScaloneta Is Structured This Way

1. Start where pairing and supervision are strongest (Escalon 1).
2. Transfer to a second paired-sensor environment (Escalon 2).
3. Stress-test domain generality in physiological signals (Escalon 3).

This sequence reduces ambiguity: each escalon isolates a different risk source (data scale, modality distortion, transfer robustness).

## Public-Facing Priorities (Next 60-90 days)

1. Finalize Gate 4.5 pending scheduler runs.
2. Publish Gate 5A comparison matrix (descriptor x mechanism).
3. Build Gate 5B communication package for scientific and investor audiences.
4. Prepare Escalon 2 launch brief with criteria, resources, and expected milestones.

## Freshness Stamp
