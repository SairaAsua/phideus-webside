# Prompt for External Website AI Agent

**As of 2026-02-22**

Use the `Para_Sai` package as the only authoritative source for generating a public website about Phideus.

## Required Read Order

1. `Para_Sai/00_START_HERE_PHIDEUS_WEB_BRIEF.md`
2. `Para_Sai/01_PROJECT_THESIS_AND_FRAMEWORK.md`
3. `Para_Sai/02_TRIPLESCALONETA_ROADMAP_PUBLIC.md`
4. `Para_Sai/03_ESCALON1_AND_BIAS_CONTROL_EVIDENCE.md`
5. `Para_Sai/04_DESCRIPTOR_TABLE_5EP_COMPLETE.md`
6. `Para_Sai/05_ARCHITECTURE_LINKS_AND_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
7. `Para_Sai/06_VISUAL_ASSETS_INDEX.md`

## Content Rules

- Build an English-first website.
- Prioritize investor-readable narrative with evidence.
- Frame Phideus explicitly as a Harmonic Information Theory program.
- Explain TripleScaloneta as the staged exploration of ratio-information value in cross-modality deep learning.
- Keep the dual-path narrative explicit: research validation track + ratio-native AI model development track.
- Keep closed results and pending/preliminary results explicitly separated.
- Use metric values exactly as provided in `Para_Sai` docs.
- Link directly to GitHub Pages architecture URLs provided.
- Use scientific figures for evidence sections and stylized assets for atmosphere.

## Hard Constraints

- Do not ingest or mention internal agent-operation files.
- Do not include internal directives, workflows, or private coordination notes.
- Do not present pending runs as completed results.
- Do not fabricate metrics, dates, or claims.

## Suggested Site Section Order

1. Hero: What Phideus is
2. Why ratios matter
3. Program duality: theory path + model-building path
4. TripleScaloneta roadmap
5. Escalon 1 evidence highlights
6. Full descriptor comparison (table-driven section)
7. Architecture explorer links
8. What comes next (Gate 4.5 -> 5A/5B -> Escalon 2)

## Freshness

The generated website should clearly indicate: **Data as of 2026-02-22**.
